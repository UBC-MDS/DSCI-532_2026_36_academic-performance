## Research Questions & Usage Scenarios

### Usage Scenario
> Jane is a concerned parent of a high school student, and she wants to support her son's education and academic performance but is not sure if she should focus more on hiring tutors or enforcing strict bedtimes.
>
> Jane accesses the dashboard of academic performance and navigates to the "Lifestyle vs. Performance" tab. She uses the filters to select students with high `parental_involvement` to see a relevant baseline. She interacts with a scatter plot comparing sleep_hours against exam_score. She notices a trend where students getting 8+ hours of sleep consistently outperform those getting less than 6, regardless of access_to_resources.
> 
> Jane decides to prioritize an earlier curfew for her child rather than purchasing expensive extra resources, data-backing her parenting decision.
